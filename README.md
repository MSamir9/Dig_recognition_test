# Digit recognition webapp test
## Model:
We trained a deep learning model on MNIST dataset.The model was trained for 10 epochs and 32 batches with 20% validation split.
## Accuracy:
The testing accuracy of this model is 99%.
## Model deployment:
1. Firstly, we convert the model to Tensorflow.js and save it.
2. We used the HTML file from https://github.com/carlos-aguayo/carlos-aguayo.github.io to create a webpage, with slight changes in the body and style.
